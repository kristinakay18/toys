As a first time mom, I know how many options of baby swings there are out there. This swing/bouncer has been wonderful to use! We set it up in the gym so that if our 2 month old daughter wakes up during our workout, we can have a safe and entertaining place to put her. The music and mobile keep her entertained and. I love that there are many song options so it doesn't get old! The ability to turn this swing into a bouncer is so convenient. It is pretty easy to disconnect the bouncer from the plugged in swing and I feel like my daughter is safe when I carry her in it since she is buckled in and the bouncer part has handles so it is sturdy and secure. I haven't used the pivot feature but it seems very easy and practical. Overall, I am pleased with this product!",5,83641063,2 month

IT’s recommended that if you’re going to use a light at all with a baby to use red, it doesn’t seem to bother my little guy at all. We started using this with our 3 month old because the plug in white night light was disrupting his sleep and stumbling around in the dark or turning on lights to change him wasn’t an option. He loves the wind down setting, we walk into the room when it starts and I tell him it’s time to rest, we do our nighttime routine and then turn on the sleep noise. We’ve only been using it for a few days but it’s been improving everyone’s sleep! I hear our little guy stir in his bassinet next to the bed and then settle very fast back to sleep without needing to be picked up, shushed or a pacifier in his mouth. I don’t like that the main difference between this rest and the rest + is the battery backup, that’s a $30 difference for just that one thing.",5,86388242,3 month

Currently, I have a nap time setting and different wake up times depending on if it's a weekday or the weekend. But for my 3 month old, I use the Rest mostly for the white noise machine.

With my other children, I generally just put teethers in the fridge because the freezer got them too cold for the little baby’s hands and so it wasn’t very effective and provided little relief. With this teething holder set that is no issue at all. I got this around the time that my 4 month old began to teethe and was miserable but was just learning to grasp things and bring them to his mouth so it was ideal. He went to town on it! I love that there are 2 double sided teethers so that he can use a particular one depending on which teeth he is cutting. As a bonus he has never gotten bored with this. With the open handles I’m able to use connecting rings to clip it to his chair so that it won’t fall to the floor. Being able to tether it like this is a huge game changer! That means we can safely use it on outings by being able to attach it to his stroller, car seat, etc. My girl is a year older and cutting canines and she even loves to use it. We may have to get another one so that she doesn’t always take his when he needs it. The quality is outstanding, just as you’d expect with this brand, and I’ve already recommended it to others. It’s so innovative and smart that it makes you wonder how we did things before it came along. This would be an excellent gift.",5,80233568,4 month

PROS: variety of night light colors and sounds )although I only use the orange hue to not wake up babe and 1 sound since she’s used to it) CONS: aside from app, buttons to control light brightness and sound volume are on the bottom of the machine. They are not illuminated. When it’s nighttime and I don’t have my phone on me, it’s a guessing game as to which buttons to press to control the machine. If the buttons were on top or illuminated by the night light I’d give this 5 stars.

So far, she only chews on them, but I look foward to when I can sit and work with her to sort and identify the different shapes. I also love that it comes with two sets of each shape (10 shape pieces all together) so that one inevitably gets lost there will be a replacement ready. Overall, I couldn't be happier with this toy!

We have a 3 year old and an 8 month old that will be sharing a room soon, and we needed a way to help our 3 year old learn when it was okay for him to get up out of bed so that he wouldn't wake the baby. We set an ""alarm"" on the Hatch to light up and softly play the sound of birds chirping each morning- when he hears and sees this, he knows it's okay to come out of his room. I can also adjust the alarm straight from my phone (so if we want to sleep in a bit longer, we can change the timer or if we are up early and see that he is also awake we can just turn the Hatch on from our phone). I like that there is a variety of sounds and colors for the light, and it's really nice that you can adjust how loud you want the sound and how bright you want the light. My only ""complaint"" is that I wish they had a better option for white noise. We use the Dohm sound machine instead for sleep- it's not as harsh as the Hatch's TV static sound and not as distracting as the ""laundry washer"" sound.",4,86388242,8 month
